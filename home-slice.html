			<h1> Home Slice Website Redesign </h1>

			<p> Home Slice Pizza is a local Austin Pizzeria in Austin, TX. For an Iron Yard project, we got to take a not-so-design-heavy website and reinvent it. Home Slice Pizza was a fun project. Their current site (https://homeslicepizza.com) is very simple and to the point. I wanted to create a more inviting, more modern, and more visual website than what they have now. DISCLAIMER; this is not a project I did for compensation, I mean no offense to Home Slice or their product. This was just a personal side project. </p>

			<h2> The First Steps </h2>

			<p> Since Home Slice is a live and existing site, first steps included taking what was already on their site, and creating flow charts and wordlists to get a better feel as to how a current user traverses throughout the site, what theyâ€™ll be on the site for, and what information they would find the most useful. This lead to hours, days open, location, and menu being of the most important. Thusly, this information had to be prominent and easy to find. Since it is a restaurant website, showcasing the type of food, the vibe of the restaurant, and the culture of the targeted audience was important.  </p>

			<h2> The Challenges </h2>

			<p> Talking about the biggest struggles with the project, the first scratch-that-and-start-over moments, maybe some project-specific issues or obstacles that were faced and how they were dealt with. </p>

			<h2> The Final Moments </h2>

			<p> Not totally sure what to put here. Probably just some input into final final decisions, maybe some gab about what it was like working on mockups, coding, whatever the final steps of the project were. </p>
