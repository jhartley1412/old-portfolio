			<h1> Home Slice Website Redesign </h1>

			<p> Home Slice Pizza is a local Austin Pizzeria in Austin, TX. For an Iron Yard project, we got to take a not-so-design-heavy website and reinvent it. Home Slice Pizza was a fun project. <a href="https://homeslicepizza.com"> Their current site </a> is very simple and to the point. I wanted to create a more inviting, more modern, and more visual website than what they have now. DISCLAIMER; this is not a project I did for compensation, I mean no offense to Home Slice or their product. This was just a personal side project. </p>

			<h2> The First Steps </h2>

			<p> Since Home Slice is a live and existing site, first steps included taking what was already on their site, and creating flow charts and wordlists to get a better feel as to how a current user traverses throughout the site, what they’ll be on the site for, and what information they would find the most useful. This lead to hours, days open, location, and menu being of the most important. Thusly, this information had to be prominent and easy to find. Since it is a restaurant website, showcasing the type of food, the vibe of the restaurant, and the culture of the targeted audience was important.  </p>

			<h2> The Challenges </h2>

			<p> Again, since this currently already exists, making something completely new, but still encompassing the basics, and brand, of the restaurant were important. Keeping from not making the site too cliché, or too busy was the most difficult. Most of my sites I was looking at for inspiration were restaurant sites (<a href="https://www.dominos.com/en/">Dominos</a>, <a href="https://www.toppers.com">Toppers</a>, <a href="http://www.bk.com">Burger King</a>) where there is a lot of heavy aesthetics and big images of the food. I ended up moving away from that idea due to both time constraints and lack of high quality images. I ended up with a more cleaner design, using a lot of white space (something that I had previously been struggling with) to let text breathe more, and use images as more of an accent to let newcomers know what kind of restaurant the establishment is.  </p>

			<h2> The Final Moments </h2>

			<p> In the end I came up with something clean and easy to read, but isn’t too high class. After all, Home Slice Pizza likes to stay true to its community atheistic and doesn’t try to be a high class Italian restaurant. </p>
