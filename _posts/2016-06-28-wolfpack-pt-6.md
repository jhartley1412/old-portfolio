<h2> Back and forth and back and forth </h2>

Since going back and reorganizing everything, it’s been mostly wireframes for the last few days. I’ve gone through a few iterations so far, tweaking bits here and there based on the teams feedback. We had our weekly agile meeting today and my next sprint is finishing up wireframes and (hopefully) starting on building some of the HTML. I’ve felt bad about my back-end and front-end teammates waiting on me to finish up my end of  the work.

Sketch is so great. Not perfect, but close. Creating wireframes has made this project more conceptual in my mind, and I’m able to organize the navigation and pages much more easily. We’ve gone back and forth with a few features. The profile page is always a struggle for me. At least with side projects like this, I never know what information to add apart from contact information and an avatar. Luckily, consolidating means more information to add. I’ve thought up adding a sort of mini navigation on the bottom of the profile page for the account settings and messaging and such. I do better with a lot of information. It’s something to organize :3
