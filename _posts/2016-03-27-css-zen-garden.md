<h2> Futurism </h2>

This weekends project is all about CSS animations and styling a website in a theme based off of an art history movement. I chose Futurism, which is something I briefly studied in college. I love the heavy influence of movement and foreground and background melding together that makes up Futurism. For the CSS Zen Garden, I wanted to focus on the blending foreground and background elements, less on the "overpowering technology" side of things. I love paintings that seem to move on the canvas, have majestic colors and dynamic shapes.

<h2> No HTML </h2>

Since we are doing a CSS Zen Garden challenge with this project, there is no touching the HTML (minus adding some Typekit typefaces, and CSS normalize).
I'm really excited for this project. The idea of only worrying about the styling of a site is a welcome break from the designing of where things should go and how best to present a user centric flow. We get to spend <span class="sec-font"> 3 </span> days to plan out and play around with different styles, fonts, colors, etc. It'll be like coloring in an adult coloring book page, except we get to extend and minimize outlines, shapes, and borders.
