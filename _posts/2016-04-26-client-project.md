Blog Post April 26th
--------------------

It was nice working with a client for a change. Not that I don't like personal projects and such, it's just nice to have someone (who isn't a designer) look at your work and show you a view you probably wouldn't have ever saw. Working with another designer was also nice, but it definitely had it's stresses. I like working with others, but I'm usually worried that I'll fall behind, or end up having people waiting on me before they can continue. But when someone is better at one thing, and your better at another it makes it easy to split up the workload a bit.
I've had experience working with clients before, and it really is nice (maybe I've just been really lucky). You have (in my experience) enough set rules to start a project, but enough freedom to go off in all sorts of different directions. My hurtles usually come in ringing myself back enough so that I don't go too far off in one direction just to have the client like an entirely different direction. But Working on my portfolio and self brand again is kind of teaching me a little more of that, which is always good.
