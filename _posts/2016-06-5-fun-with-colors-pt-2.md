<h2> Change in direction </h2>

So I came back to the wine cellar picture, and was playing with different typefaces, and one of them, Lakeside, stood out to me, and made me think of a majestic harvest moon. I ended up completely scraping the wine cellar idea and wanted to make an illustration of an august moon setting. I ended up making a super stylized happy moon, using the same three colors, in a barren countryside.

I have a habit of giving cutesy faces to inanimate objects. I kept playing around with the harvest moon idea, again trying to come up with a setting where I could use this. A promotion for a local moon festival came to mind. Thus I made a little illustration of the moon with a moon festival sign.
