<h2> Back to the grindstone </h2>

OK, now that the hype of Pokemon Go has died down a little (not really, more like my legs have given out from all the walking), and I’ve settled back into my part-time job, it’s time to get back to Find My Furball. I was making good progress on coding out the basic HTML for my front-enders to work with a week ago. Unfortunately we weren’t able to meet last week because of illness, and this week we’re meeting tomorrow, which is later than originally planned. I’ve only got one more page to finish up for my sprint, and I’m getting close. It’s a more complicated page than the others. For the benefit of the user, and to condense similar information together, the profile page will have a mini navigation for account settings, messages and their pet entries all while being able to look at their personal information on the top.

I’ve gotten 2/3 of the mini pages done, and hope to finish up the full page by tonight. Of course it’s a little bit jarring looking at basic CSS/Sass. Since we haven’t really discussed the kind of styling we want to aim for (fonts, colors, images, etc), I’ve just been using a mix of baby blue, pink and grey to distinguish between buttons and would-be images and borders and such. Every time I preview the pages in Chrome it looks like a cotton candy site. Makes me hungry. 

But I’ll be excited to get to the styling. After this page, and our meeting tomorrow, I’m hoping to get a good list of the rest of the pages they need done (as well as fix some webpack server issues I’ve been dealing with on my laptop) and then I can move into styling and figuring out the best look and feel for the app.

<h2> What’s the deal with tables though? </h2>

I’ve heard a lot of bad things about using tables in HTML. But I feel like this is a situation where it’s a little more needed. For one of the pages the user will be able to look at their current and past entries, and each entry will have a bunch of pet information describing the pet. Of course just using <span class="sec-font bg-font"> < span > </span> tags can accomplish this easy, but to make it look aligned and even, I feel tables are more practical. Now that I think of it, I’ll probably want to go back to a few other pages and incorporate tables on those as well (shoot). 

Of course you learn something every day. Oddly enough, I never knew about the indicator <span class="sec-font bg-font"> last-of-type </span> for CSS. I’ve always gone the hard way, trying really hacky methods of using <span class="sec-font bg-font"> last-child </span>  and  <span class="sec-font bg-font"> nth-child(x) </span> that wouldn’t be much use in real world applications. Makes the little things a heck of a lot easier. 

I’ve really been enjoying coding HTML and CSS/Sass again, but it’ll make for a nice break to just be in Illustrator messing around with colors and fonts and picking the best look for a design. This will also be the first project

<h2> Not only of sight and sound, but of mind… </h2>

Every few months I get new background material to work by. I’ve gone back and forth between songs and TV shows the last year or so, each usually lasting a few weeks (or however long it takes to marathon a series). During the Iron Yard it was a good mix of Game Grumps remixes and Fallout radio playlists. I work best (music wise) with songs that either don’t have “normal lyrics” and are repetitive. Best to work when you don’t have to pay too much attention to what you’re listening to. Although will Fallout it was more that I had heard those songs so much while exploring the Wasteland that they’re now perfect background ambience. 

TV shows can sometimes be a good background source too. At least when I’ve seen whatever it is that’s playing. Lately I’ve been watching (re-watching technically) The Twilight Zone. My mom and I watched it all one summer when I was a kid, and with it on Netflix now, I’m loving re-watching the old episodes. I love oldies. I wish there were more black and white movies and TV shows on Netflix that I could just watch endlessly (not that my Watchlist isn’t long enough). Anyway, back to work!
