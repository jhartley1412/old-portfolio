<h2> Recreational sports app </h2>

Our next project is to design a strictly mobile app for a recreational sports team. I chose to make an app specifically for a swim team (but one that could be used for any sport).

In researching different sports related apps, one thing I find fairly commonplace is the lack of heavy feedback from pressing buttons. Unlike with desktop, there isn't a lot of place to have fancy effects happening when you click, hover, or swipe a button or page. 

A lot of them (a lot of iPhone apps in general it seems) usually have nav bars of some sort on the bottom of the screen. But not all; most that don't have a bottom nav bar will have some sort of drop down or list page that acts as their main navigation. 

The main goal of the app seems to be to let the manager/coach or player get in and out as fast as possible (like most apps), without being distracted or delayed by fancy animations or unnecessary effects.
