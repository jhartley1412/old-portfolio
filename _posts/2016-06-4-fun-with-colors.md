<h2> Color generators </h2>

So the other day someone from Slack posted a link to one of those websites that generates color combinations. This one, Color Calculator, gives you the option to decide what kind of relationship you want the colors to have with each other (complementary, monochromatic, analogous, etc), and I’ve always wanted to try out one of those create-a-design-based-off-of-limited-colors challenges.  

<br>

Just for fun I tried it out. Using a dark red I generated an analogous color combination and opened a new file in Illustrator. Based off that colors I immediately thought of wine and vineyards. I ended up warming up with a little champagne (or rosé) icon.

Trying to think up a more flushed out design, I thought up a scenario where a local restaurant or wine bar was having a special event. I designed a promotional menu with some featured kinds of wine and snacks.

I’m not quite happy with it so far. Looks a little too boxy. I wouldn’t mind some more practice with informational posters and designs. Maybe I’ll make that one of my next side projects…
