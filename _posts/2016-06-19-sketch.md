<h2> It's so simple </h2>

I'm finally learning <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com"> Sketch </a>. I had heard some good things about it during The Iron Yard, and have been wanting to try it out for a while. With the side project Find My Furball happening it seemed like perfect timing. 

Before ever using Sketch, most of what I heard was that it was like Illustrator but more geared towards UI and UX design. Illustrator's a personal favorite of mine, and there is no doubt it's great for designing logos and vector art. But since getting into UI design, I've noticed the extent of which both Illustrator and Photoshop seem to have when it comes to their shortcomings. Sketch is specifically designed for web and UI/UX design, and it shows it. It's so smooth to use, includes only the features you would want in designing an interface, and, best of all, it shares a lot of shortcut commands that Illustrator uses. Made getting started and learning the basics go along so much quicker.

I'll always be an Adobe girl, but Sketch is quickly becoming one of my top favorites.
