<h2> I learned something today </h2>

The significance of user stories and use cases and user flows are becoming more and more clear to me. I’m a visual thinker, I need to be able to see something to work with it. As I was starting on wireframes, figuring out where components should go, and seeing what pages could be condenses and what pages we still needed based on layout, I realized I needed to do some backtracking and catch my bearings. 

I ended up redoing the site map based on the changes that we were deciding for the wireframes. We were able to condense a few pages, and think up some neat features to add. Now it’s back to the wireframes, and getting more into Sketch. I have learned something cool with Sketch though. Apparently when you name an artboard and follow it with a “/“ it creates a folder when you export it (e.g. Artboard/Homepage will export to a folder called Artboard with a file called Homepage inside it). Fun facts of the day.
