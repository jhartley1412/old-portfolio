<h2> CSS Zen Garden </h2>

Almost done for the weekend on my CSS Zen Garden project. I'm really liking how the header and CSS animations are looking, I'm just a little concerned that it's all looking too "Dr. Suess-y." The colors don't look all that inviting (not that Futurism is necessarily the most "inviting" time in art history). Maybe I'm just worrying too much since I just now realized that my color scheme is exactly the same as my shower curtains (thought it looked familiar!). After this weekend I'm going to be focused on getting the middle sections looking the way I want them to on the largest breakpoint (desktop size). Minus that, I'm really happy with how responsive everything is (or seems to be so far on my screen)!
