	This week I (re)learned some of the basics of jQuery. It's a nice change from the Java Script of last week (although, when I have some more free time..., I'd like to do some more Java Script tutorials. See if I can get a better sense of it, and not have to rely on jQuery so much). Mostly been doing some practices, getting back into the flow of things. I've got some new CodePens (super hacky right now) of a few of them. 
	I also went back after a few weeks to redo some old CSS Animations on CodePen. I had lost a few of them (forgot I wasn't in a program that I could "save as," and forgot to Fork them...), and it's been weighing over my shoulder to go back and redo them best I can. At least this time I managed to make them prettier!
