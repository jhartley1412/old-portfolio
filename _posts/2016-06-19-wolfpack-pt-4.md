<h2> The wheels are turning </h2>

Today was Wolfpack's second "official" meeting. We got a lot done. Well, at least I felt like I did. I'm definitely feeling much more productive with my time. We were able to go over the site map I made as a group and make a few changes that really make it feel more concrete. I was also able to work on some user stories. I'm seeing now how the UX research side of things really plays into the overall concept of the design. It's all starting to click! Of course now my mind won't stop racing with different ideas we can try out. Different style, color schemes, logos, etc. Luckily this next sprint I'm starting wireframes.

I forgot how nice it is to work in the same room as other people. It's so convenient being able to just ask someone across the table a quick question, or ask the team as a whole about an idea and have everyone come to a decision face-to-face as opposed to just on Slack. (not that I don't love Slack!) It reminds me of the good ol' days in the design room~
