			<h1> Marathon Health </h1>

			<p> Marathon Health was a company I worked with back in Vermont. They are a company that strives to make sure there is affordable and reliable health services in any given workplace environment. When I worked there, I was tasked with coming up with new designs for posters, pamphlets, and brochures. </p>

		<h2> Programs Used </h2>
		<p> Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign </p>


		<h2> Working Within a Brand </h2>
		<p> Obviously, being an already established company, I was given a style guide to work within. Colors and fonts were supplied to me, and I had to come up with designs that would fit with their style. At first I went through a lot of coming up with ideas, showing my superiors, and going back and making edits. It was oddly fulfilling being able to match something with a brand (although frustrating at times). </p>

		<h2 class="clear">  Making Things Ready for Print </h2>
		<p> Almost everything I did was print related. Then whenever I was done with a design that got approved, I was the one to send it off to their in-house print designers who would take it from there. I conversed with them many times via email. Luckily, I had worked on print projects in the past, something that’s becoming more and more second nature to me. </p>


		<h2 class="clear">  Working in an Office </h2>
		<p> Working within a big office, it’s easy to get lost (metaphorically speaking). However the location where I was at made it easy for people to come find me and I even got asked to do a few side projects for individual people. I was able to do more than what I had initially been brought on to help with, including working on motivational posters, as well as preliminary designs for an upcoming web app for the company’s clients. </p>
