			<h1> Nectar & Root </h1>

			<p> Nectar & Root is a Vermont business that specializes in flower arrangements for and helping with wedding preparations. They were going through a rebranding, and I was one of the possible contestants. I wanted to make the flower’s the “center of attention” and used a lot of images of Nectar & Root arrangements displayed in a brochure. </p>

		<h2> Programs Used </h2>
		<p> Illustrator, Photoshop </p>


		<h2> Mood Boards/Style Tiles </h2>
		<p> Being that Nectar & Root deals with flower arrangements and weddings, a floral heavy and mainly feminine style was needed to match. I chose a dark purple, feminine enough without alienating any men, combined with light pastel blues and yellows, representing the flowers. The balance of light and dark worked well and gave a good sense of professionalism. </p>


		<h2> Early Concepts and Final Designs </h2>
		<p> Since the company deals with flower arrangements, a floral, pretty, light, and delicate design seems like the best fit. Giving focus to the flowers, the “product” is important. On the brochure, the flowers are the big draw, within the brochure, once you’re interested, looking at what Nectar & Root can do for you, you see a happy bride and groom. A gesture at “this can be you with Nectar & Root!” </p>

		<p> Since flowers are the big center of attention, what would be the best way to make sure that they stand out? Nectar & Root likes to customize each arrangement based off of the couple and their feelings towards each other. Giving each bouquet at a wedding a bouquet tag gives the arrangement some attention. It shows the guest why these flowers were picked, providing information about the individual flowers used, what they symbolize, and why they fit the couple they’re accompanying. </p>

		<p> In the end, I designed a brochure, a bouquet tag and examples of business cards. The business cards would have a grain texture, where the logo and name would be poking upward from the card. The name and contact information would be on the back, simple and easy. You get the information you need and have a floral, yet sturdy card to remember it by. </p>


		<h2 class="clear">  Challenges </h2>
		<p> Rebranding a company is no small task. In all honesty it was the business card that challenged me the most. I didn’t want it to be flashy, that didn’t seem to suit the company. But I needed something for it to stick out from the rest of the crowd. I decided on the grain texture to give it that extra something. It helped give it the look and feel of something garden-like, with the professionalism of simple and centered type. </p>
