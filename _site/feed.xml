        <title>The wheels are turning</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt; The wheels are turning &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was Wolfpack’s second “official” meeting. We got a lot done. Well, at least I felt like I did. I’m definitely feeling much more productive with my time. We were able to go over the site map I made as a group and make a few changes that really make it feel more concrete. I was also able to work on some user stories. I’m seeing now how the UX research side of things really plays into the overall concept of the design. It’s all starting to click! Of course now my mind won’t stop racing with different ideas we can try out. Different style, color schemes, logos, etc. Luckily this next sprint I’m starting wireframes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;blog-image drop-shadow&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog-post-images/fmf-sitemap2.png&quot; alt=&quot;fmf site map&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forgot how nice it is to work in the same room as other people. It’s so convenient being able to just ask someone across the table a quick question, or ask the team as a whole about an idea and have everyone come to a decision face-to-face as opposed to just on Slack. (not that I don’t love Slack!) It reminds me of the good ol’ days in the design room~&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Boxes and arrows</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt; I haven&#39;t made a user flow in a long time... &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So full disclosure. I had to look up exactly what a user flow consisted of. It’s been a few months since I had made one, and that included first time practice. I did however find a &lt;a href=&quot;http://uxmovement.com/wireframes/site-flows-vs-user-flows-when-to-use-which/&quot;&gt; really neat site &lt;/a&gt; that helped re-educate me. I also learned what the difference between a user flow and a site map are, which became really helpful when working with my teammates and planning out how big we wanted the site to be. It also is a huge weight lifted to be able to visually see what each page leads to. I’ve started on the site map so far. Tomorrow we’ll all meet together again and I’ll be able to get some input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;blog-image drop-shadow&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog-post-images/fmf-sitemap.png&quot; alt=&quot;fmf site map&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to organize the site map best I could by color coating it. I gave purple to the static pages that would just hold basic information or navigational links, green was given to pages which involved form and submit functions where a user would input information, and yellow to pages that were just made up of search results.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A new side project</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt; Find my Furball &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve started our brainstorming today. Our goal is to create an app for pet owners who have recently lost a pet. Let’s say a woman lost her dog, she’d be able to use the app, post what kind of dog she had, some physical information (size, weight, breed, color, etc) and in what location she lost it or last saw it. Other people in her area who also have the app would be able to check and see that that dog was lost, and be on the lookout for said pet. We’re thinking that the app would also be a good tool for veterinarians and animal shelters, where a lot of lost dogs and pets are taken to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got a good idea where to start on it. Of course, being the only designer in a group of front and back enders, a lot of the early work will be on me and Jen (since it was her project idea). We’ve decided to organize our workflow using agile, like we did for the group project at The Iron Yard, so today was mostly just about planning out what each person should take care of in their first sprint. The first few sprints are going to be pretty heavy on my end, with me doing both UX and UI for the project. This week I’m focusing on creating a site map and, if I can, some user flow charts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wolfpack</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt; Wolfpack is back! &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My old team from our group project during The Iron yard is back together. We’ve decided to start a brand new side project together. It’ll be nice to have a legitimate project to work on, and also to be part of a group (more pressure to get stuff done when you have other people counting on your work to be finished). We’ve been meeting a few times here and there since The Iron Yard ended, but that was mostly us trying to decide if we wanted to do something new or go back and revamp one of our old projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since our group projects were so long ago, and we’ve learned so much since then, we all decided that a brand new project would be more challenging and fun. This week we decide on a new project to start. It was tossed around that we could attempt making a game of some sort, or a social app. I’m pretty indifferent with whatever we choose. I just want to have something to design for! The less in my hands the project is, I figure, the more realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fun with colors pt 2</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt; Change in direction &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I came back to the wine cellar picture, and was playing with different typefaces, and one of them, Lakeside, stood out to me, and made me think of a majestic harvest moon. I ended up completely scraping the wine cellar idea and wanted to make an illustration of an august moon setting. I ended up making a super stylized happy moon, using the same three colors, in a barren countryside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;blog-image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog-post-images/harvest-moon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Harvest Moon&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a habit of giving cutesy faces to inanimate objects. I kept playing around with the harvest moon idea, again trying to come up with a setting where I could use this. A promotion for a local moon festival came to mind. Thus I made a little illustration of the moon with a moon festival sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;blog-image drop-shadow&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog-post-images/moon-festival.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Moon Festival&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fun with colors</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt; Color generators &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the other day someone from Slack posted a link to one of those websites that generates color combinations. This one, Color Calculator, gives you the option to decide what kind of relationship you want the colors to have with each other (complementary, monochromatic, analogous, etc), and I’ve always wanted to try out one of those create-a-design-based-off-of-limited-colors challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just for fun I tried it out. Using a dark red I generated an analogous color combination and opened a new file in Illustrator. Based off that colors I immediately thought of wine and vineyards. I ended up warming up with a little champagne (or rosé) icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;blog-image glass-image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog-post-images/glass.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wine glass&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to think up a more flushed out design, I thought up a scenario where a local restaurant or wine bar was having a special event. I designed a promotional menu with some featured kinds of wine and snacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;blog-image drop-shadow&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog-post-images/wine-poster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wine Poster&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not quite happy with it so far. Looks a little too boxy. I wouldn’t mind some more practice with informational posters and designs. Maybe I’ll make that one of my next side projects…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Seattle Trip</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt; Visiting the Bellevue office &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I got to take a brief, private tour of a local office in Bellevue. Thanks to family connections, I got to see real world UI and UX designers and PMs in action. I also got to see a few wireframes, flowcharts, and mockups of the teams current project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was nice being able to see exactly what a UX or UI job would entail in the “real world.” Thanks to The Iron Yard, I have a pretty good level of foundation knowledge for a junior UI or UX job (at this point I”m looking more for UI, possible UI - development). But it’s nice to get a realistic sense of what I might actually be doing in a UI/UX job. It also helps me better prepare for questions that I would want to ask in a interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company, Agilysys, is a leading provider of hospitality software solutions (they design and market POS and PMS systems, as well as many others). The team I got to shadow was working on a new product for kiosk machines that would stand in Grab n Go outlets. Basically, they are creating an interaction that would happen when a customer wants to buy anything from a meal, to a quick snack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to talk with one of the head UX designers, who talked about how one of their biggest challenges is creating a product that would work for a business that has one simple, strict menu, as well as for a business with multiple menus, multiple choices (a burger that has choices of lettuce, cheeses, etc), and combinations. It’s really interesting seeing a team work through different designs, different user stories, and workflows that lead to working prototypes and Beta systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful for being able to see some real world offices, and meet some great designers and developers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Merge Conflicts</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt; It&#39;s like, 2am &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright. So this has happened enough times that I need to write this somewhere so I don’t have to go and keep finding it on the internet. Merge conflicts. You getting a bunch of .scssc file conflicts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delete them: 
&lt;span class=&quot;sec-font bg-font&quot;&gt; git rm [file name] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;( &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1380670/how-do-i-fix-a-merge-conflict-due-to-removal-of-a-file-in-a-branch&quot;&gt; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1380670/how-do-i-fix-a-merge-conflict-due-to-removal-of-a-file-in-a-branch &lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about those super fun DS_Store files? Remember the .gitignore stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show those hidden files: 
&lt;span class=&quot;sec-font bg-font&quot;&gt; defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;( &lt;a href=&quot;http://ianlunn.co.uk/articles/quickly-showhide-hidden-files-mac-os-x-mavericks/&quot;&gt; http://ianlunn.co.uk/articles/quickly-showhide-hidden-files-mac-os-x-mavericks/ &lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then delete the DS_Store files: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;sec-font bg-font&quot;&gt; find . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm -f –ignore-unmatch &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and type “.DS_Store” into the .gitignore file (you may have to create it*): 
&lt;span class=&quot;sec-font bg-font&quot;&gt; git commit -m ‘.DS_Store banished! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*git add .gitignore ( &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/107701/how-can-i-remove-ds-store-files-from-a-git-repository&quot;&gt; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/107701/how-can-i-remove-ds-store-files-from-a-git-repository &lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3D Painting!</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt; Look at this! &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw this video on LinkedIn the other day. This is incredible to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe class=&quot;blog-video&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/I8OuSJKSkwE?list=PLKfWL8IXgKBte4TfD53pLaHONfSYCX0RH&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to be honest, the rate of which technology has grown in my lifetime has sometimes been unnerving (I may, or may not, buy into the whole Skynet thing). But virtual reality is something I’m really excited for, now more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, growing up doodling in sketchbooks every night (without fail), the idea of being able to paint, in 3D is like a dream come true. As a kid, Harold and the Purple Crayon was one of those books that made me wish reality wasn’t so restricting. I thought the idea that drawing something and having it come to life, no strings attached, was incredible. This seems like the closest thing to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; VR filled future &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of thing gets me excited for what kind of projects I could be a part of in the future. One of my personal projects is to create a “game” or interaction experience where a child could virtually live through historical events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout my research of different methods of teaching, one of the reoccurring ideas that’s stuck with me is that memory and experience are tied together. We are more likely to remember something when we have some sort of stimuli connected with that memory. The same way the smell of a certain dish may remind us of that vacation we took as a kid. Or the way the color purple always makes us think of that favorite dress we wore to a school dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create an experience for children (students) that would help engage, and educate, through experience, is a dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Client Project</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt; RedArena &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redarena.org&quot;&gt; RedArena &lt;/a&gt; is a local Dripping Springs organization that offers physical therapy, and traditional therapy, to children and adults while riding horses. Horseback riding is a specialized therapy option that can be extremely beneficial for children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Creating an app for a real client &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was nice working with a client for a change. Not that I don’t like personal projects and such, it’s just nice to have someone (who isn’t a designer) look at your work and show you a view you probably wouldn’t have ever saw. Working with another designer was also nice, but it definitely had it’s stresses. I like working with others, but I’m usually worried that I’ll fall behind, or end up having people waiting on me before they can continue. But when someone is better at one thing, and your better at another it makes it easy to split up the workload a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had experience working with clients before, and it really is nice (maybe I’ve just been really lucky). You have (in my experience) enough set rules to start a project, but enough freedom to go off in all sorts of different directions. My hurtles usually come in reigning myself back enough so that I don’t go too far off in one direction just to have the client like an entirely different direction. But working on my portfolio and self brand again is kind of teaching me a little more of that, which is always good.&lt;/p&gt;
