        <title>Client Project</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;blog-post-april-26th&quot;&gt;Blog Post April 26th&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was nice working with a client for a change. Not that I don’t like personal projects and such, it’s just nice to have someone (who isn’t a designer) look at your work and show you a view you probably wouldn’t have ever saw. Working with another designer was also nice, but it definitely had it’s stresses. I like working with others, but I’m usually worried that I’ll fall behind, or end up having people waiting on me before they can continue. But when someone is better at one thing, and your better at another it makes it easy to split up the workload a bit.
I’ve had experience working with clients before, and it really is nice (maybe I’ve just been really lucky). You have (in my experience) enough set rules to start a project, but enough freedom to go off in all sorts of different directions. My hurtles usually come in ringing myself back enough so that I don’t go too far off in one direction just to have the client like an entirely different direction. But Working on my portfolio and self brand again is kind of teaching me a little more of that, which is always good.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mobile Apps</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;blog-post&quot;&gt;Blog Post&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In researching different sports related Apps, one thing I find fairly commonplace is the lack of heavy feedback from pressing buttons. A lot of them (a lot of iPhone apps in general it seems) usually have nav bars of some sort on the bottom of the screen. But not all; most that don’t have a bottom nav bar will have some sort of drop down or list page that acts as their main navigation. The main goal of the app seems to be to let the manager/coach or player get in and out as fast as possible (like most apps), without being distracted or delayed by fancy animations or unnecessary effects.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Web App</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;April 5th&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So last week was my first time designing an app for the web…it was interesting. I had alwyays looked at apps as primarily phone based, and found it interesting that web apps are so much more common then I thought. 
We decided to focus on the LinkedIn Home page. A lot of people have trouble traversing through LinkedIn, or don’t care about what is displayed on the current home page. For my home page, I wanted to mostly simplify what was already there. I was focusing on a user that used LinkedIn as a portal for their job search. It wasm’t as highly focused on finding new connections, more about staying in the know with current news (which would be chosen by the user, depending on their personal or career interests), and easily finding new job postings and oppertunities.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jquery</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;March 28, 2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;This week I (re)learned some of the basics of jQuery. It&#39;s a nice change from the Java Script of last week (although, when I have some more free time..., I&#39;d like to do some more Java Script tutorials. See if I can get a better sense of it, and not have to rely on jQuery so much). Mostly been doing some practices, getting back into the flow of things. I&#39;ve got some new CodePens (super hacky right now) of a few of them. 
I also went back after a few weeks to redo some old CSS Animations on CodePen. I had lost a few of them (forgot I wasn&#39;t in a program that I could &quot;save as,&quot; and forgot to Fork them...), and it&#39;s been weighing over my shoulder to go back and redo them best I can. At least this time I managed to make them prettier!

        <title>Css Zen Garden</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;March 27, 2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost done for the weekend on my CSS Zen Garden project. I’m creating a page inspired by the Futurism art movement of the early 1900s. I’m really liking how the header and animations are looking, I’m just a little concerned that it’s all looking too “Dr. Suess-y.” The colors don’t look all that inviting (not that Futurism is necessarily the most “inviting” time in art history). Maybe I’m just worrying too much since I just now realized that my color scheme is exactly the same as my shower curtains (thought it looked familiar!). After this weekend I’m going to be focused on getting the middle sections looking great on the largest breakpoint. Minus that, I’m really happy with how responsive everything is (or seems to be so far on my screen)!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Restaurant Redesign</title>
        <description>
&lt;h2 id=&quot;blog-post&quot;&gt;Blog Post&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first big projects coming up; redesigning a website! I’m excited to be designing from scratch (as opposed to creating webpages that already exist). I mostly just hope that I’m able to follow through with my work until the end. During school, one of my biggest downfalls was getting burned out too early in the design process. Fingers crossed I don’t sprint headfast at the beginning and run out of breath by the end!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inspirational-sites&quot;&gt;Inspirational sites&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://www.dominos.com/en/
	Not only is it a fellow pizza joint, I’ve always thought Dominos has had a strong graphic design team (both in brand and overall presence). They have a good mix of humor and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://www.yaghisnewyorkpizzeria.com
	Another pizza site, this one is clean, easy to read, and uses a tantalizing color combo of red and green (that isn’t Christmas-y, but actually makes you kind of hungry), I also like that it’s mostly centered&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://www.toppers.com
	Yet another pizza place, although I don’t love long pages you have to scroll down to, I do love the grittiness and “streets”-style of the site, and will probably add a sense of “young culture” into Home Slice’s website&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://www.vertskebap.com/nutrition/
	Specifically I do like how, on the Nutrition and About pages, they have a banner of their ingredients lain out on white&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://www.bk.com
	I like that they have big, in your face font sizes, and, like most of the other sites, big res images of their food&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/which-page-layout
	Sites like these, that are centered, always are visually comforting to me. I like the organization, and how easy it is to scroll down the pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://www.pandora.com
	I like how Pandora has a fixed min-width (isn’t responsive). It’s a simple radio site, and almost reminds me of a control panel for music. I also just noticed that whichever album cover you’re currently listening to is centered to the middle of the screen (roughly). It’s no more complicated than it needs to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://www.meltshop.com
	This site (minus the parallax scrolling) is a lot like what I’m trying to do as well. Fill the screen with information and color, but also be toned down enough so that it’s not distracting as much as blended in. I worry though how image heavy these sites are compared to what I’m able to get online.&lt;/p&gt;
