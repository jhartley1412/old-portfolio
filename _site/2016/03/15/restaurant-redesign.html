	    <h2> First big project at The Iron Yard </h2>

<p>It’s the first big weekend project we have at The Iron Yard. It’s our third weekend (the first was basic HTML and CSS practices, the second was recreating an existing site) and we are redesigning an existing website. We each got to pull local Austin restaurants out of a hat, and are redesigning said website as we see fit.</p>

<p>I’m excited to be designing from scratch. I mostly just hope that I’m able to follow through with my work until the end. During college, one of my biggest downfalls was getting burned out too early in the research (sketching) stage, and not having the energy to put as much effort into finalizing the product. Fingers crossed I don’t sprint headfast at the beginning and run out of breath by the end!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2> Inspirational sites </h2>

<p>These are sites that I’m currently looking at to help inspire what my redesign should look like:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dominos.com/en/"> https://www.dominos.com/en/ </a> <br />
	Not only is it a fellow pizza joint, I’ve always thought Domino’s has had a strong graphic design team (both in brand and overall presence). They have a good mix of humor and functionality.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.yaghisnewyorkpizzeria.com"> http://www.yaghisnewyorkpizzeria.com </a> <br />
	Another pizza site, this one is clean, easy to read, and uses a tantalizing color combo of red and green (that isn’t Christmas-y, but actually makes you kind of hungry), I also like that it’s mostly centered</p>

<p><a href="https://www.toppers.com"> https://www.toppers.com </a> <br />
	Yet another pizza place, although I don’t love long pages you have to scroll down to, I do love the grittiness and “streets”-style of the site, and will probably add a sense of “young culture” into Home Slice’s website</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vertskebap.com/nutrition/"> http://www.vertskebap.com/nutrition/ </a> <br />
	Specifically I do like how, on the Nutrition and About pages, they have a banner of their ingredients laid out on white</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bk.com"> http://www.bk.com </a> <br />
	I like that they have big, in your face font sizes, and, like most of the other sites, big res images of their food</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/which-page-layout"> http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/which-page-layout </a> <br />
	Sites like these, that are centered, always are visually comforting to me. I like the organization, and how easy it is to scroll down the pages.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pandora.com"> http://www.pandora.com </a> <br />
	I like how Pandora has a fixed min-width (isn’t responsive). It’s a simple radio site, and almost reminds me of a control panel for music. I also just noticed that whichever album cover you’re currently listening to is centered to the middle of the screen (roughly). It’s no more complicated than it needs to be.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.meltshop.com"> https://www.meltshop.com </a> <br />
	This site (minus the parallax scrolling) is a lot like what I’m trying to do as well. Fill the screen with information and color, but also be toned down enough so that it’s not distracting as much as blended in. I worry though how image heavy these sites are compared to what I’m able to get online.</p>
