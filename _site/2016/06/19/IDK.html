	    <h2> I haven't made a user flow in a long time... </h2>

<p>So full disclosure. I had to look up exactly what a user flow consisted of. It’s been a few months since I had made one, and that included first time practice. I did however find a <a href="http://uxmovement.com/wireframes/site-flows-vs-user-flows-when-to-use-which/"> really neat site </a> that helped re-educate me. I also learned what the difference between a user flow and a site map are, which became really helpful when working with my teammates and planning out how big we wanted the site to be. It also is a huge weight lifted to be able to visually see what each page leads to. I’ve started on the site map so far. Tomorrow we’ll all meet together again and I’ll be able to get some input.</p>

</span></p>

<p>I tried to organize the site map best I could by color coating it. I gave purple to the static pages that would just hold basic information or navigational links, green was given to pages which involved form and submit functions where a user would input information, and yellow to pages that were just made up of search results.</p>
