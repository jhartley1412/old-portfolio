	    <h2> Find my Furball: A new side project </h2>

<p>We’ve started our brainstorming today. Our goal is to create an app for pet owners who have recently lost a pet. Let’s say a woman lost her dog, she’d be able to use the app, post what kind of dog she had, some physical information (size, weight, breed, color, etc) and in what location she lost it or last saw it. Other people in her area who also have the app would be able to check and see that that dog was lost, and be on the lookout for said pet. We’re thinking that the app would also be a good tool for veterinarians and animal shelters, where a lot of lost dogs and pets are taken to.</p>

<p>We’ve got a good idea where to start on it. Of course, being the only designer in a group of front and back enders, a lot of the early work will be on me and Jen (since it was her project idea). We’ve decided to organize our workflow using agile, like we did for the group project at The Iron Yard, so today was mostly just about planning out what each person should take care of in their first sprint. The first few sprints are going to be pretty heavy on my end, with me doing both UX and UI for the project. This week I’m focusing on creating a site map and, if I can, some user flow charts.</p>
