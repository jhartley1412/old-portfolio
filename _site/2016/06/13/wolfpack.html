<p>My old team from my group project during The Iron yard is back together. We’ve decided to start a side project, all four of us, just for fun (I mean experience!). It’ll be nice to not only have a legitimate project to work on again, but also to be part of a group (more pressure to get stuff done when you have other people counting on your work to be finished). Tomorrow is our first official meeting.</p>

<p>My old team from our group project during The Iron yard is back together. We’ve decided to start a brand new side project together. It’ll be nice to have a legitimate project to work on, and also to be part of a group (more pressure to get stuff done when you have other people counting on your work to be finished). We’ve been meeting a few times here and there since The Iron Yard ended, but that was mostly us trying to decide if we wanted to do something new or go back and revamp one of our old projects.</p>

<p>Since our group projects were so long ago, and we’ve learned so much since then, we all decided that a brand new project would be more challenging and fun. This week we decide on a new project to start. It was tossed around that we could attempt making a game of some sort, or a social app. I’m pretty indifferent with whatever we choose. I just want to have something to design for! The less in my hands the project is, I figure, the more realistic.</p>
