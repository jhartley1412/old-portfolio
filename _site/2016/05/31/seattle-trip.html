    <h2> Visiting the Bellevue office </h2>

<p>Today I got to take a brief, private tour of a local office in Bellevue. Thanks to family connections, I got to see real world UI and UX designers and PMs in action. I also got to see a few wireframes, flowcharts, and mockups of the teams current project.</p>

<p>It was nice being able to see exactly what a UX or UI job would entail in the “real world.” Thanks to The Iron Yard, I have a pretty good level of foundation knowledge for a junior UI or UX job (at this point I”m looking more for UI, possible UI - development). But it’s nice to get a realistic sense of what I might actually be doing in a UI/UX job. It also helps me better prepare for questions that I would want to ask in a interview.</p>

<p>The company, Agilysys, is a leading provider of hospitality software solutions (they design and market POS and PMS systems, as well as many others). The team I got to shadow was working on a new product for kiosk machines that would stand in Grab n Go outlets. Basically, they are creating an interaction that would happen when a customer wants to buy anything from a meal, to a quick snack.</p>

<p>I got to talk with one of the head UX designers, who talked about how one of their biggest challenges is creating a product that would work for a business that has one simple, strict menu, as well as for a business with multiple menus, multiple choices (a burger that has choices of lettuce, cheeses, etc), and combinations. It’s really interesting seeing a team work through different designs, different user stories, and workflows that lead to working prototypes and Beta systems.</p>

<p>I’m grateful for being able to see some real world offices, and meet some great designers and developers.</p>
