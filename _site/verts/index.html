			<h1> Verts Mediterranean Grill </h1>

			<p> A few months ago, the restaurant Verts Kebap was going through a branding redesign, transforming them in the now Verts Mediterranean Grill. I was among some of the contestants who applied to be their graphic designer for their rebranding. </p>

			<h2> The First Steps </h2>

			<p> Since the company deals with flower arrangements, a floral, pretty, light, and delicate design seems like the best fit. Giving focus to the flowers, the “product” is important. On the brochure, the flowers are the big draw, within the brochure, once you’re interested, looking at what Nectar & Root can do for you, you see a happy bride and groom. A gesture at “this can be you with Nectar & Root!” </p>

		<div class="project-desc">
			<h2> The Challenges </h2>

			<p> Since flowers are the big center of attention, what would be the best way to make sure that they stand out? Nectar & Root likes to customize each arrangement based off of the couple and their feelings towards each other. Giving each bouquet at a wedding a bouquet tag gives the arrangement some attention. It shows the guest why these flowers were picked, providing information about the individual flowers used, what they symbolize, and why they fit the couple they’re accompanying.  </p>

		<div class="project-desc desc-right">
			<h2> The Final Moments </h2>

			<p> In the end, I designed a brochure, a bouquet tag and examples of business cards. The business cards would have a grain texture, where the logo and name would be poking upward from the card. The name and contact information would be on the back, simple and easy. You get the information you need and have a floral, yet sturdy card to remember it by. </p>
