			<h1> Home Slice Pizza </h1>

			<p> Home Slice Pizza is a local Austin Pizzeria in Austin, TX. For an Iron Yard project, we got to take a not-so-design-heavy website and reinvent it. Home Slice Pizza was a fun project. Their current site is very simple and to the point. I wanted to create a more inviting, more modern, and more visual website than what they have now. DISCLAIMER; this is not a project I did for compensation, I mean no offense to Home Slice or their product. This was just a personal side project. </p>

	<div class="project-desc">

		<h2> Programs/Languages Used </h2>
		<p> Photoshop, Illustrator, HTML, CSS/SASS, jQuery, Jekyll </p>


		<h2> Mood Boards/Style Tiles </h2>
		<p> When doing research on Home Slice Pizza I found that the restaurant had a very young vibe to it. There was graffiti displayed proudly on the outside walls, the music inside was mostly pop, and most of the customers were either families with older kids, or young adults. Deciding on the right direction to go on was more difficult than I had thought. It took a lot of changes to little details to finally decide on an overall style. </p>

		<div class="trio-container">

			<a href="../images/home-slice/Style-tile-1.jpg" class="lightbox-trigger landscape">
				<img class="image-third image-border" src="../images/home-slice/Style-tile-1.jpg">
			</a>

			<a href="../images/home-slice/Style-tile-2.jpg" class="lightbox-trigger landscape">
				<img class="image-third" src="../images/home-slice/Style-tile-2.jpg">
			</a>

			<a href="../images/home-slice/Style-tile-3.jpg" class="lightbox-trigger landscape">
				<img class="image-third image-border" src="../images/home-slice/Style-tile-3.jpg"> 
			</a>

		</div>

		<p class="clear"> Above are only three of the five style tiles I initially made. I ended up going with a combination of all three. The vibes I wanted to translate were “young adult,” “family friendly” and “old-style Brooklyn pizza joint.” Serving classic New York style pizza is a big part of Home Slice’s brand. I wanted to keep the edginess that came with that image. </p>


		<h2> Mockups and Early Concepts </h2>

		<p> Taking a lot of inspiration from other pizza restaurant websites, I wanted Home Slice’s website to have an edgy look to it. I went through a few different layouts for the home page, trying to balance what users would want to see first as they load the page. Hours and location were of big importance, and so was easily displaying that the restaurant technically was in two different buildings, one just for take-out, and one for dining in. I kept going back and forth with how I wanted to present that information, landing on the home page being split into two sections, the take-out and the dine in. My thought process was that this would clearly and quickly let a user who had never been to Home Slice Pizza know that there were two options for getting food. </p>

		<p> I played with the position of the hours, some designs with them listed on top and some on the side. Below the navigation bar seemed like the best place with the design. My thought was that when people are looking at the navigation bar they’d see the hours right below. </p>

		<div class="trio-container">

			<a href="../images/home-slice/Home-MockupLarge v2.jpg" class="lightbox-trigger landscape">
				<img class="image-third" src="../images/home-slice/Home-MockupLarge v2.jpg">
			</a>

		</div>

		<p> This concept changed however, many times. The site kept feeling too bulky, and there was little white space for the eye and the user to breath. I ended up cutting the overabundance of photographs and settled on a clean, “grown-up” New York style with a lot of white space and clearer location and hours information. Although it loses some of that classic New York “edge” I had originally wanted, the cleaner look makes it seem more professional and more “family friendly.” </p>

		<h2 class="clear">  Challenges </h2>
		<p> How to handle the organization was the biggest challenge on the home page. There was so much information on their site, and it was tough trying to balance it all. It was one of the first projects were I had to make a lot of sacrifices for what made the most sense for the user, over what I thought would be a “cool design decision.” </p>
