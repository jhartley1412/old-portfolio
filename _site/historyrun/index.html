			<h1> HistoryRun </h1>

			<p> HistoryRun was my final project for college. We were given the prompt of finding a problem to solve, and HistoryRun ended up becoming the future inspiration for LevelUpLearning. I had done a bunch of research on using games as a tool for teaching, and I ended up creating a prototype for a game that would help teach middle school students American history via a video game. The objective was to create a game that teach kids via experience.

			<br>
			A published interactive version of the project: <a href="https://indd.adobe.com/view/ae029efd-e613-4b6c-84f9-78b549f5b26b"> HistoryRun </a> </p>

			<h2> The First Steps </h2>

			<p> One of the best methods of learning is through personal experience. When someone remembers things based off of visual, olfactory, or auditory stimuli, they are less likely to forget that memory. Using this knowledge, I wanted to put the gamer in the middle of historic events, and have them experience those events first hand. </p>

			<h2> The Challenges </h2>

			<p> The task of representing a game without having any game experience is probably the most challenging thing I ever had to work around. My main focus was on the UI aspects of the project, specifically how the player would interact with the world, and how to design icons, menus and informative containers. </p>

			<h2> The Final Moments </h2>

			<p> I still want to be a part of a project where we are trying to create an alternative, ideally more fun, method of teaching young students. Alternative methods of teaching and education will always be something that I’m interested in and want to be a part of in the future.  </p>
