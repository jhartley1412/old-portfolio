			<h1> Project 1 </h1>

			<p> This an explanation of the overall project and what the "problem" was and pictures of mockups and overall design. Hopefully the description will be long enough so that it'll take up a good amount of space, and probably there will be a few pictures of the final product. This description will also include final colors, fonts, etc. but not in "style guide" format, more just descriptions about which colors & typefaces were chosen and why and/or how they relate to the project at hand. </p>

			<h2> The First Steps </h2>

			<p> Words about the sketches, first directions, what the original plan was, yadda yadda yadda. Shots of sketches from notebook/github and maybe some wireframes mixed in. </p>

			<h2> The Challenges </h2>

			<p> Talking about the biggest struggles with the project, the first scratch-that-and-start-over moments, maybe some project-specific issues or obstacles that were faced and how they were dealt with. </p>

			<h2> The Final Moments </h2>

			<p> Not totally sure what to put here. Probably just some input into final final decisions, maybe some gab about what it was like working on mockups, coding, whatever the final steps of the project were. </p>
