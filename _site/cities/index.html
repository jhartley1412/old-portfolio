			<h1> Cities Across America </h1>

			<p> Cities Across America started out as a school project to instill the basics of inDesign. After the class wanted, I wanted to expand on the project and keep adding to it whenever I could. I wanted to make a book about famous cities in America that I have either traveled to, would like to live in, or just find interesting, and give each city a chapter where a reader can learn about their history, what they have to offer, and fun facts about that city.
			<br> <br> 
			Each chapter would open with a full size photograph of the city skyline, giving the reader a sense of what that city looks like, what the city vibe is, etc. There would also be a small quote about that city in the top left corner, either from someone famous who lived in that city, or from someone pronounced talking about said city. This was to give a sense of culture about the city, to really give a reader who has never been to, let’s say Houston, a sense of what kinds of people, what kind of food, what kind of music, smells, sights someone walking around the city might experience when there. The next two pages are dedicated to history and facts about the city. The type is organized in a playful way depending on the city to resemble a famous building in that city. A big part of a city is its architecture. Giving credit or notice to the buildings that help make a city important or interesting is huge to that cities culture and history. </p>

			<h2> The First Steps </h2>

			<p> When starting this project, originally, I just had to come up with a topic that I could make into a book. I chose cities mainly because of my interest in travel, and my experience in living (or staying in hotels) in various cities around the country. I wanted to do something that I personally connected to. I have taken art history classes for most of my educational career, and (later in said career) developed a love for architecture, and an interest in city design and history. Doing a book about cities I love or am interested in seemed like a good fit. So thus, Cities Across America was thought up. </p>

			<h2> The Challenges </h2>

			<p> The biggest challenges that I faced (and am still facing) is the fact that I am not a photographer. I don’t personally own, or always have access to, high definition photographs of cities around America. My main intention when creating this book was not to show off my skills with a camera, it was to present my personal interest in the history and culture of the different cities in our country. America is a big country, and because of that, each city has such a different vibe, a different culture, a different feel to each other. That’s what makes our cities so unique. I wanted to show that via a book that is fairly heavy on the photography. Finding good, usable, and free images will always be a challenge when creating personal projects.  </p>

			<h2> The Final Moments </h2>

			<p> Cities Across America is something I am still adding to, still creating, and very much hope to make a reality one of these days. I love the idea of giving people who don’t have the access to, or don’t have a means to travel across the country to get insight as to what cultures exist in America, and what other cities are out there. </p>
