			<h1> LevelUpLearning </h1>

			<p> LevelUpLearning is (primarily) a tablet app that would be used in elementary schools specifically for kids who are falling behind in certain subjects for whatever reason. The idea came from thinking up a way to “make learning fun,” and a persona interest in bringing modern technology into the classroom. Alternative methods of teaching has always been a big interest of mine, and only aided in designing this app. LevelUpLearning was created to be an alternative method of teaching for kids who don’t learn as well from the standard lecture-worksheet routine used today. Tablets are already becoming more involved in elementary school systems, and LevelUpLearning was made to piggyback that developing concept.

			<h2> The First Steps </h2>

			<p> To narrow down the research to make a viable MVP of LevelUpLearning, I chose to focus on the average 4th grade curriculum. In America, 4th grade is typically the time where fractions, the solar system, the American revolution and understanding themes  in literature are introduced or expanded upon. The lessons had to be represented in a way that was both intriguing and playful, but also kept away from being overwhelming or difficult. Thumbnails came to mind; they’re both easily recognizable and give the user a sense of what’s coming next (i.e. click the thumbnail, new information pops up).  </p>

			<h2> The Challenges </h2>

			<p> Of course, designing for kids is tricky. There were a lot of moments where something seemed too difficult, or too abstract for an elementary school student to understand quickly enough to be plausible. Desktop navigation was a big obstacle during this project; what would be the best way to display navigation? should it be in the header? should there be thumbnails? etc. At the end of the day, the desktop Dashboard page of the app is the most differently designed page from all the other pages. 
			<br>
			Since the Dashboard is such a different page in general, and needs to display so much different information, it got special treatment. On tablet and mobile, the Dashboard page would only need to display whatever lessons a user would need that day. On desktop however, just showing the current lessons was too little of information to warrant its own page. On a desktop, the Dashboard would display a little bit of information from throughout the app (recently earned badges, completed lessons), as well as display the days current lessons in a list form, to better suit the style of the page. </p>

			<h2> The Final Moments </h2>

			<p> Level Up Learning is an app that would be used as an alternative method of teaching for students who are struggling in school for whatever reasons. Ideally it would teach via interaction; videos, games, puzzles, etc, where the student user would be able to traverse around the lesson, get feedback, and be encouraged to continue their education, and get an insight as to what they could do as a career based on the skills they just learned. Level Up Learning is supposed to be able to engage and encourage students in school, and give them a reason to continue learning inside and outside the classroom. </p>
