  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I’m currently living in Austin, TX. Graduated with a BFA in Graphic Design from Champlain College, as well as The Iron Yard after studying UI and Web Design. While at The Iron Yard I studied with fellow students in design, front-end and back-end. I even worked with a bunch of students from other classes, helping them with design tips, style tiles, and font choices.</p>

<p>Growing up I got to travel all around the world. By the time I was 15 I had visited over a dozen different countries. Being able to see the world at such a young age gave me a deep respect for art and design, and their history.</p>

<p>A big interest of mine are alternative methods of teaching. Introducing tablets, games, and interactive methods of teaching is where I believe our education system is headed. Or at least it should. The traditional ways of teaching, sitting in a classroom, listening to a teacher talk, maybe taking notes, is becoming outdated. It’s not always the best way to teach a child either. Some kids learn better through interaction, and sometimes keeping a child engaged is what helps them try or succeed in school.</p>
