    <h3> My education background  </h3>
    I’m currently living in Austin, TX. I moved a few months after graduating from Champlain College, in Burlington, VT. There I earned a BFA in Graphic design. After living in Austin for about a year, I found The Iron Yard and attended the <span class="sec-font"> 12 </span> week code school, studying UI design. 

    <br />

    <h3> How I got into design </h3>
    Ever since I was a little kid I was doodling on everything. As I grew up, and went to college, I entered the design world. In college it was graphic design, studying typography, branding, and the history of graphic design. It was there that I took a few web design classes and became just as (maybe even more) interested in coding (HTML and CSS) and designing something that was interactive.

    <br />

    <h3> Some fun facts </h3>
    Growing up I got to travel all around the world. By the time I was <span class="sec-font"> 15 </span> I had visited over a dozen different countries. Being able to see the world at such a young age gave me a deep respect for art and design, and their history. 

    A big interest of mine are alternative methods of teaching. Introducing tablets, games, and interactive methods of teaching is where I believe our education system is headed. Or at least it should be. The traditional ways of teaching, sitting in a classroom, listening to a teacher talk, maybe taking notes, is becoming outdated. It’s not always the best way to teach a child either. Some kids learn better through interaction, and sometimes keeping a child engaged is what helps them try or succeed in school.
