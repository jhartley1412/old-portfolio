			<h1> Cities Across America </h1>

			<p> Cities Across America started out as a school project to instill the basics of InDesign. After the class ended, I wanted to expand on the project and keep adding to it whenever I could. I wanted to make a book about famous cities in America that I have either traveled to, would like to live in, or just find interesting, and give each city a chapter where a reader can learn about their history, what they have to offer, and fun facts about that city. </p>

		<h2> Early Concepts </h2>

		<p> When given the prompt for this project, the only restriction was that it be a book. We got to chose the subject, the design, the front matter, etc. I wanted to do something about travel, but didn’t want it to necessarily be a “travel book.” I ended up narrowing my subject to cities across America, focusing on cities I’ve been to myself, or want to live in at some point. The cities became the stars of the book, each one getting a chapter made up of one chapter opening page and two pages full of that cities history. </p>

		<p> The chapter opening pages would be a introduction to that city, displaying a photograph of the city skyline, with a quote about that city on the top left corner. The chapters themselves would include history about the city with at least one column of text in the shape of a famous building in that city. I wanted each chapter to feel like a representation of the city. This also gave insight to the culture of the city. A big part of a city is it’s architecture. Giving credit or notice to the buildings that help make a city felt like a no-brainer. </p>


		<h2 class="clear">  Challenges </h2>
		<p> Something I wanted to make sure of was that the design of this book wasn’t too bland, and wasn’t too “hacky.” I wanted design choices I made that were a little more out there to be subtle, to not distract from the book’s content. I hope that the end result (that I have to far) is whimsical, but not childish or cheesy. </p>
