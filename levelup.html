			<h1> LevelUpLearning </h1>

			<p> LevelUpLearning is an app that would be used to aide the education of elementary school students who, for whatever reasons, are struggling in school. It could be used in the classroom as a learning tool, a method of presenting homework, or a aide for home-school kids to continue their studies. The app consists of pre-determined lessons where a child learns by exploring, and by doing, as opposed to the standard sitting in a classroom and listening or filling out a worksheet. The idea started with finding the solution to an age old question, “How do you engage a child who seems disinterested in school?” LevelUpLearning is my answer.

			<h2> The First Steps </h2>

			<p> LevelUpLearning started out as an alternative method to teaching that was based on interaction by the student, and explores the concept that memory is directly connected to personal experiences. You are more likely to remember something if there is some sort of sensory connection to it (e.g. smelling hot cocoa always reminds you of that winter skiing trip your family went on when you were a kid). 

			<br>
			<br>

			When doing research I found myself continuously drawn to a lot of articles and case studies about the benefits, and validity, of using games as a teaching method (a field that I’ve studied before) and found a fairly even split on results. The main takeaways I got was that the best method of teaching depends on the child, and that games are a great source of getting a child to engage in whatever he/she is doing. Wanting to meet halfway, LevelUpLearning became an app full of adventures and exploration as opposed to a game that “made learning fun.” LevelUpLearning wasn’t going to be a game, it was going to be an app to engage students in learning.

			<br>
			<br>

			When thinking up the best methods of engaging a child, gamification seemed like the most appropriate. A big aspect of LevelUpLearning was to encourage education and give the user a positive attitude towards learning. Using gamification, I came up with the Badge Collection feature.  Earning badges gives the child a sense of accomplishment and allows them to see their progress in a positive and encouraging light. </p>

			<h2> Finding the Style </h2>

			<p> Being that my main audience was young kids, I wanted to find colors and fonts that were both playful and imaginative, as well as educational and easy to understand. I went through a few different combinations before deciding on a style tile created from a combination of all my previous ones. I chose Montserrat as my typeface for headers. This font is bold enough on it’s own that it commands a sense of authority without being overwhelming or standoffish. It worked perfect with Arimo as the body typeface. Arimo is simplistic, witty and, most importantly, easy to read. All important traits for text that will be used to education and direct.

			The colors consisted mostly of warm yellows and oranges for anything structural (headers, borders, etc). With kids you want something bright and inviting. It also kept a nice sense of consistency throughout the different pages. Each individual class would also be given a color. Science would be purple, math would be blue, social studies and history would be green, and english and reading pink. These colors, mostly cool colors (with the exception of pink) made a nice contrast against the gold yellow headers. </p>

			<h2> Building It and Challenges </h2>

			<p> When building the MVP for this project, I used a mix of HTML, Sass and jQuery for dropdown menus and modals. One of the biggest challenges for this project was making it responsive. Not in the sense that actually making it responsive was hard, more the changes I needed at each breakpoint. I had started my designing at mobile and worked my way up. When a user enters the home page, or the lessons page, the app will display that days lessons. On mobile and tablet the lessons are presented in thumbnail form; round cornered squares with images inside. However this design didn’t work as well on a desktop size screen. It was off-putting and looked like something was missing.  

			<br>
			<br>

			With help from my peers, I was able to come up with the list form that you see now. On desktop, a list made more sense. When you’re on mobile or tablet chances are that you want to get to your lessons as quickly as possible, without too much distraction. On desktop there’s more space and more time to breath, to show the user their latest earned badges and completed lessons. They get to see some of their current accomplishments, and a wider and more fluid to-do list of lessons. </p>
