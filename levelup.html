			<h1> LevelUpLearning </h1>

			<p> LevelUpLearning is an app that would be used to aide the education of elementary school students who, for whatever reasons, are struggling in school. It could be used in the classroom as a learning tool, a method of presenting homework, or a aide for home-school kids to continue their studies. The app consists of pre-determined lessons where a child learns by exploring, and by doing, as opposed to the standard sitting in a classroom and listening or filling out a worksheet. The idea started with finding the solution to an age old question, “How do you engage a child who seems disinterested in school?” LevelUpLearning is my answer.

				<h2> The First Steps </h2>

				<p> LevelUpLearning started out as an alternative method to teaching that was based on interaction by the student, and explores the concept that memory is directly connected to personal experiences. You are more likely to remember something if there is some sort of sensory connection to it (e.g. smelling hot cocoa always reminds you of that winter skiing trip your family went on when you were a kid). 

				<br>
				<br>

				When doing research I found myself continuously drawn to a lot of articles and case studies about the benefits, and validity, of using games as a teaching method (a field that I’ve studied before) and found a fairly even split on results. The main takeaways I got was that the best method of teaching depends on the child, and that games are a great source of getting a child to engage in whatever he/she is doing. Wanting to meet halfway, LevelUpLearning became an app full of adventures and exploration as opposed to a game that “made learning fun.” LevelUpLearning wasn’t going to be a game, it was going to be an app to engage students in learning.

				When thinking up the best methods of engaging a child, gamification seemed like the most appropriate. A big aspect of LevelUpLearning was to encourage education and give the user a positive attitude towards learning. Using gamification, I came up with the Badge Collection feature.  Earning badges gives the child a sense of accomplishment and allows them to see their progress in a positive and encouraging light. </p>

				<h2> The Challenges </h2>

				<p> Of course, designing for kids is tricky. There were a lot of moments where something seemed too difficult, or too abstract for an elementary school student to understand quickly enough to be plausible. Desktop navigation was a big obstacle during this project; what would be the best way to display navigation? should it be in the header? should there be thumbnails? etc. At the end of the day, the desktop Dashboard page of the app is the most differently designed page from all the other pages. 
				<br>
				Since the Dashboard is such a different page in general, and needs to display so much different information, it got special treatment. On tablet and mobile, the Dashboard page would only need to display whatever lessons a user would need that day. On desktop however, just showing the current lessons was too little of information to warrant its own page. On a desktop, the Dashboard would display a little bit of information from throughout the app (recently earned badges, completed lessons), as well as display the days current lessons in a list form, to better suit the style of the page. </p>

			<h2> The Final Moments </h2>

			<p> Level Up Learning is an app that would be used as an alternative method of teaching for students who are struggling in school for whatever reasons. Ideally it would teach via interaction; videos, games, puzzles, etc, where the student user would be able to traverse around the lesson, get feedback, and be encouraged to continue their education, and get an insight as to what they could do as a career based on the skills they just learned. Level Up Learning is supposed to be able to engage and encourage students in school, and give them a reason to continue learning inside and outside the classroom. </p>
