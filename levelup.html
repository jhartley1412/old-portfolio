			<h1> LevelUpLearning </h1>

			<p> LevelUpLearning is an app that would be used to aide the education of elementary school students who, for whatever reasons, are struggling in school. It could be used in the classroom as a learning tool, a method of presenting homework, or a aide for home-school kids to continue their studies. The app consists of pre-determined lessons where a child learns by exploring, and by doing, as opposed to the standard sitting in a classroom and listening or filling out a worksheet. The idea started with finding the solution to an age old question, “How do you engage a child who seems disinterested in school?” LevelUpLearning is my answer.

			<h2> The First Steps </h2>

			<p> LevelUpLearning started out as an alternative method to teaching that was based on interaction by the student, and explores the concept that memory is directly connected to personal experiences. You are more likely to remember something if there is some sort of sensory connection to it (e.g. smelling hot cocoa always reminds you of that winter skiing trip your family went on when you were a kid). 

			<br>
			<br>

			When doing research I found myself continuously drawn to a lot of articles and case studies about the benefits, and validity, of using games as a teaching method (a field that I’ve studied before) and found a fairly even split on results. The main takeaways I got was that the best method of teaching depends on the child, and that games are a great source of getting a child to engage in whatever he/she is doing. Wanting to meet halfway, LevelUpLearning became an app full of adventures and exploration as opposed to a game that “made learning fun.” LevelUpLearning wasn’t going to be a game, it was going to be an app to engage students in learning.

			<br>

			When thinking up the best methods of engaging a child, gamification seemed like the most appropriate. A big aspect of LevelUpLearning was to encourage education and give the user a positive attitude towards learning. Using gamification, I came up with the Badge Collection feature.  Earning badges gives the child a sense of accomplishment and allows them to see their progress in a positive and encouraging light. </p>
