			<h1> LinkedIn Home Page Redesign </h1>

			<p> The LinkedIn homepage is one of those sites where there is a lot going on. One project we got was to take the LinkedIn homepage and redesign it based on a specific type of user. Since this is what I mostly use LinkedIn for, I wanted to create a homepage design based for a user using LinkedIn specifically for finding a job.  </p>

			<h2> The First Steps </h2>

			<p> Since I was focusing on someone using LinkedIn as a job search tool, I wanted the homepage to act like a portal that would provide a little information about all the types of information the user would care about; current job opportunities, how popular their profile has been lately, and current news catered towards their career. I added a tab menu on the right side where, by default, the user would see current job listings based off of their interested fields. The user would be able to switch between job listing, people they may know (since LinkedIn is, at the end of the day, about connecting the world of business), education opportunities (local classes or courses in their area) and favorites, which would consist of articles and people that the user would be able to save for later. </p>

			<h2> The Challenges </h2>

			<p> The goal of this project was not just to redesign a homepage based on a specific type of user, but also to stay within a predetermined style guide. I chose to use the style guide from <a href="https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design/typography/"> Salesforce Design System </a>. Like LinkedIn, it uses different shades of blue, but type wise is readable and professional. Using a pre-made style guide was something I’ve worked with before, but not in a code setting. I’ve worked with style guides when working on graphic design projects. Style guides are a whole other thing when dealing with code. Paying attention to the little details was interesting, and I ended up tweaking some small design elements to better fit to the guide, but it was a rewarding experience.  </p>

			<h2> The Final Moments </h2>

			<p> Redesigning a site is something that, by this time, I had done a few times. But building a site, based off of a style guide that I haven’t created was something else. In the past, I would loosely pick a style tile, and finalize the end style guide as I created mockups and coded the site out. Working with a pre-made style guide was both restraining, as well as a breath of fresh air. It had been a while since I didn’t have to worry about creating a homemade style guide, and having one made for me was a nice change of pace. </p>
