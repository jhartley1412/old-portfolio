			<h1> LevelUpLearning </h1>

			<p> The LinkedIn homepage is one of those sites where there is a lot going on. One project we got was to take the LinkedIn homepage and redesign it based on a specific type of user. Since this is what I mostly use LinkedIn for, I wanted to create a homepage design based for a user using LinkedIn specifically for finding a job. </p>

		<h2> Wireframing and Early Concepts </h2>

		<p> The biggest gripe I’ve heard from LinkedIn users who are using it to network and find a job (myself included) has always been that there is a lot of information taking up the screen that is either deemed “unimportant” or “useless.” The current homepage looks more like a Facebook dashboard than something used for networking. When redesigning the home page, I liked the idea having a little bit of everything useful to the user. The home page would act like a portal of sorts, where the user would get to check on the things that mattered to them most to them; whose viewed their profile, local job offers, and news articles about subjects they are interested in. </p>

		<p> I thought that the look of widgets worked best, with a toggle menu side bar to the right. The center widgets were made big and easy to see since that’s what most people (looking for a job) would most likely be interested in. The side menu’s would consist of local jobs (based off the users input) as well as the toggle menus for people they may know, local education options (crash courses, bootcamps, for students, local colleges to earn certain degrees), and lastly a favorites section. That would be for if a user comes across an article, a job offer or even a person on LinkedIn and wants to “save them for later.” They’d be able to store them all in their favorites, and come back to them whenever they wanted. </p>

		<h2 class="clear">  Challenges </h2>
		<p> Originally this project was to follow a certain style, and work from a predetermined style guide. Unfortunately out of two I chose, I was only able to complete one in the given time limit (the one I used was from <a href="https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/guidelines/typography/">Salesforce</a>). I got stuck up on some jQuery (the side menu and mobile screen) and wasn’t able to start the second style guide. Working from a style guide was interesting, especially working with one for code. I’ve worked within style guides for graphic design before with no problem, but matching code is a whole other task. </p>
