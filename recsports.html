			<h1> RecSports Mobile App </h1>

			<p> RecSports was a mobile app I prototyped using Invision. This was a practice in something that would only be on mobile, and something that would be used by a recreational sports team to help manage players, their stats, and upcoming games or meets. Since I used to swim on my neighborhoods swim team, making a recreational swim team app seemed like a great fit. I was able to make two flows; one for the coach (or captain) being able to add new players to their team, or check/edit current players stats, and one for viewing information about an upcoming game (or meet).

			<h2> The Final Moments </h2>

			<p> Not totally sure what to put here. Probably just some input into final final decisions, maybe some gab about what it was like working on mockups, coding, whatever the final steps of the project were. </p>
