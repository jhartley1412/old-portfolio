			<h1> RecSports Mobile App </h1>

			<p> RecSports was a mobile app I prototyped using Invision. This was a practice in something that would only be on mobile, and something that would be used by a recreational sports team to help manage players, their stats, and upcoming games or meets. Since I used to swim on my neighborhoods swim team, making a recreational swim team app seemed like a great fit. I was able to make two flows; one for the coach (or captain) being able to add new players to their team, or check/edit current players stats, and one for viewing information about an upcoming game (or meet).

			<h2> The First Steps </h2>

			<p> Creating a mobile app, after a bunch of web based projects, is more of a brain switch than I thought it would be. I ended up wanting to put so much more on a page than would have been appropriate. Or I kept nesting pages under pages under pages, which would have required a complicated navigation. Getting used to smaller text, and vertically longer screens became more fun to design. Thinking through being a swim team captain made is much easier to determine what should go first on a page, which items would be most important, and how to display stats and players. </p>

			<h2> The Challenges </h2>

			<p> Designing more mobile, and designing for a screen thats more vertical than horizontal, and designing for something that wouldn’t necessarily have a website counterpart, was completely new to me. Looking at sports apps already out there, and seeing what they did right, or did not so right, helped out a lot of organizing all the content I wanted to display in the final prototype. The biggest help when doing mockups was Photoshops app Preview that lets you see a screen on your phone without having to upload anything. This also helped with InVision since they have a compatibility were you can upload straight from Photoshop and not have to worry about uploading dozens of screens.   </p>

			<h2> The Final Moments </h2>

			<p> In the end working with InVision became something I really enjoyed. It’s one of those programs that makes me want to start a bunch of side projects just to make workable prototypes out of them. Especially with its Photoshop compatibility.  </p>
