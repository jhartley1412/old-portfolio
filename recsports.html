			<h1> RecSports Swim App </h1>

			<p> RecSports was a mobile app I prototyped using Invision. This was a practice in something that would only be on mobile, and something that would be used by a recreational sports team to help manage players, their stats, and upcoming games or meets. Since I used to swim on my neighborhoods swim team, making a recreational swim team app seemed like a great fit. I was able to make two flows; one for the coach (or captain) being able to add new players to their team, or check/edit current players stats, and one for viewing information about an upcoming game (or meet). </p>

		<h2> Mood Boards/Style Tiles </h2>
		<p> I was on a swim team growing up, so I felt pretty prepared for this project. Knowing the different kinds of teams out there helped in splitting my style tiles to represent a more competitive team, a more leisure team and a team made up of busy moms with busy schedules who joined an adult swim team to relax or get exercise. My end result was a combination of the first two, mixing competitiveness with leisure. </p>

		<h2> Mockups and Early Concepts </h2>

		<p> I had made a few user stories and use cases and decided on an app that was primarily going to be used by young adults competing at the college or mid 20s level. I wanted it to be something that the team leader or team coach would use almost daily. The main actions they should be able to do is check their teams times, switch around team members for upcoming meets, schedule upcoming meets with other coaches and team leaders, and have an easy way to message or communicate changes or shout outs to their entire team without leaving the app. </p>

		<h2 class="clear">  Challenges </h2>
		<p> After working on websites for so long, it was a bigger switch on my brain to design for purely mobile. At first I ended up wanting to add so much content that I had pages nested under pages nested under more pages. Getting used to thinking as simply as possible was a welcome change. </p>
