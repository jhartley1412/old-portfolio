			<h1> HistoryRun </h1>

			<p> HistoryRun was my final project for college. We were given the prompt of finding a problem to solve, and HistoryRun ended up becoming the future inspiration for LevelUpLearning. I had done a bunch of research on using games as a tool for teaching, and I ended up creating a prototype for a game that would help teach middle school students American history via a video game. The objective was to create a game that teach kids via experience. </p>

		<h2> Wireframing and Early Concepts </h2>

		<p> When starting this project, I struggled with how I wanted to represent my indentions. One of the best methods of learning is through experience. People are more likely to remember something if it’s connected to a visual, olfactory or auditory stimulus. So I wanted the user/player to experience events in history to better remember them, to learn them first hand. I played around with different ways of having the player go through time where each level was during a different President’s time in office, or the years right before each election. I ended up going with a point-and-click world where the player explores around American history and learns through quests and meeting historical figures. </p>

		<h2 class="clear">  Challenges </h2>
		<p> The task of representing a game without having any game experience is probably the most challenging thing I ever had to work around. My main focus was on the UI aspects of the project, specifically how the player would interact with the world, and how to design icons, menus and informative containers. </p>
